	<p>
	Firstly, I want to say that I am recruiter-friendly.  I recognise the potential benefits of talking to a recruiter, and there are a couple of recruiters that I've met in my working career that have helped me progress faster than I otherwise would.  I believe that recruiters can have value to me, and therefore I'm generally willing to hear them out on what they have to say.
	</p>
	<p>
	That being said, however, I have personal values and morals that I prefer to stand by, and I believe that ethics are very important.  I am also generally busy either with work or with personal projects, and prefer approaches to be mindful of this.  For these reasons, I have a list of requests which, if followed, will be more likely to lead to a positive response.

		<dt>Wait long enough.<dt>
		<dd>A job measured in days or weeks is definitely not a job I'm looking to leave.</dd><br />
		<dt>Email first.</dt>
		<dd>Drop me an email introducing the opportunity.  Due to busyness, I might not get back to you within working hours, or even on the same day.</dd><br />
		<dt>No work calls.</dt>
		<dd>If I'm at work, I'm being paid to give 100% of my attention to my employer.  I consider it awkward and imposing to receive recruitment calls at work.</dd><br />
		<dt>Be clear.</dt>
		<dd>Finding a message that just asks me to call with no suggestion of what it's for is a waste.  Please give me enough information to have an idea of whether it's whether it's worth me making space in my day to make a call.</dd><br />
		<dt>Understand me.<dt>
		<dd>I won't just settle for <em>any</em> tech job.  I really want to do something I'll enjoy.  I got my degree in specific subjects, and my CV and LinkedIn detail skills I've picked up while working.  Please also ask questions to expand that knowledge further.</dd><br />
		<dt>Have ethics.</dt>
		<dd>I really dislike the members of the profession that give it a bad name.  I take the time to escalate these things or, if dissatisfied, will just blanket block a recruitment firm.  Don't lie to me, misrepresent things, or send my CV to companies without my permission.  I'm reasonable as long as you are.</dd><br />
	</dl>
	<p>
	As mentioned above, if necessary, I may simply block emails from recruitment firms that have demonstrated themselves to be a waste of my time.  In the interest of openness, you can find a list of the filtered domains below.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>*@redrockconsulting.co.uk</li>
		<li>*@mayflowerltd.com</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Finally, thanks for reading this.  I hope that by taking in this information, you'll be able to provide me more value and save both of us time during our interactions.
