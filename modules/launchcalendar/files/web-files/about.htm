        This subdomain hosts the output of an <b>unofficial</b> scraper that runs hourly against <a href="http://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/" target="_blank">the SpaceFlightNow launch schedule</a>.  It attempts to turn the list of future launches into an iCal file for subscribing to in your calendar software of choice.  The script is open source, and downloadable from my <a href="https://github.com/simonhollingshead/puppet_built_webserver/tree/master/modules/launchcalendar/files/launchcalendar.py" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
	<p>
            If you're using Google Calendar, please be aware that they only check external calendars once or twice a day, so you may not get updates as quickly, and all unknown launches (which get set to today's date) won't be moved until many hours after midnight.</p>
	<p>
            None of this would be possible without <a href="http://spaceflightnow.com/" target="_blank">SpaceFlightNow</a> (a website which I have no affiliation to).  If you're interested in space, and you don't yet use them as a source for news, you absolutely should.  All data contained within the calendar entries is taken from their webpages, and is not owned by me at all.
